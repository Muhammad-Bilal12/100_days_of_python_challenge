# For loops
# loops is used for repeatition
# loops is only working on iterable objects

# Write a program to spell the name

# name = "Bilal"
# for char in name:
#     print(char)
#     if char == 'a':
#         print("Got it!")


# Print the elemrnt of list

# fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Orange","Strawberry"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit) 
#     if fruit == "Mango":
#         print("Sweet King!")




# Range Function

# range()

# Iterable object to generaate some number between between the given range

# Print the count 1 to 10
# for count in range(10):  # range always start count with 0
#     print(count)


# to print 1 to 10
# for i in range(1,11): # start with 1 and stop with 10 [10 is exclusive]
    # print(i)




# Lets make a program to print table of the given number

# n = int(input("Enter your number : "))

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(f"{n} x {i} = {n*i}")




# Write a programo to print number 1 to n (n is given by user)

# for i in range(5):
    # print(i)



# range(start , stop, step  )

# step add with start and generate new value
# step by default = 1


for i in range(0,101,10):
    print(i)
