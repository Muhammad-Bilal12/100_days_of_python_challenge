# Exercise 7
# Solution

# take Integer value from User 
n = int(input("Enter Your first number : "))
m = int(input("Enter Your first number : "))

# Calculate and print the result
ans1 = n+m
print("Addition of",n,"and",m,"is", ans1)
ans2 = n-m
print("Subtraction of",n,"and",m,"is", ans2)
ans3 = n*m
print("Multiplication of",n,"and",m,"is", ans3)
ans4 = n/m
print("Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans4)
ans5 = n%m
print("Modulus/Remainder of",n,"and",m,"is", ans5)
ans6 = n//m
print("Floor Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans6)
ans7 = n**m
print("Exponent of ",n,"and ",m,"is ", ans7)
